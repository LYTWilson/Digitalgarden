# Market fragmentation 
- [7] We cannot serve all targeted people in the same way!!
As there are different targets that have different needs, marketing have to be separated into different groups to sucessfully sale their products to the targets.
## Segmentation
- [?] How should we apply these fragmentations well? 
### Demographic segmentation
It refers to segmenting the market into age, gender, generation, income class, family life cycle, family structure, place of resident and so on.
- [3] Demographic segmentation is easy to generalize.
- Generational marketing ![[POWERPNT_rHzxU7n05q.png]]
- [7] Is generational marketing effective to segment the market?
- income level and social class 
	- black cardJJ
- **geodemography**: by place of resident
	- McDonald's special burgers in specific regions
- gender
	- women drivers
### Psychographic segmentation
It divides the market into shared activities, interests and opinions (AIOs).
### Behavioural segmentation
- occasion segmentation
	- only applied for different occasions
- user status segmentation
- user rate segmentation

- [?] Are they really opposites?
- 80/20 rule 
	- treat the highly valuable 20% carefully
	- split the target into two segments, one with the 20%, another be the 80%
- long tail theory (add picture)
	- every customer is similar, therefore marketers need not divide segments of popular and unpopular 
Example: ![[Pasted image 20230301162439.png]]
- User status segmentaion (first three months discount vs. regular users)
- Usage rate segmentation (credit limit: those who borrow more can gain a lower interest rate)
