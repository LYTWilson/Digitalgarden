___
This is a procedure that the experiment subjects are shown with a stimulus that they have encountered before and asked if they could **remember** the experience *mentally* and the *details*. 

If they do not remember those details, they would be familiar with such stimulus, which is called as **knowing**, which is where you still know or recognize the stimulus but not actually remembering when that happens or what happened before.
