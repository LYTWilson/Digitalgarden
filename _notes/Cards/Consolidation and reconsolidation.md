# Synaptic consolidation
- rapid structural changes at synapses 
- results in long-term potentiation
# System consolidation
- involves in long time gradual reorganization in the brain 
- Reactiviation
	- the hippocampus replays the neural activity with a memory 
	- it requires reconsolidation to 'update' the memory
	- this forms connection with the hippocampus and the cortex
- [[Standard Model of Consolidation]] suggests that the retrieval depends on the hippocampus **during consolidation** but no longer after the consolidation is done.
- [[Multiple Trace Model of Consolidaton]], in oppose, suggests that the hippocampus still remains in use during the retrieval for long ago memories. 
- Retrograde amnesia
