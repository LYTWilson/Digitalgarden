# Concept and categories
Concept is a representation of a class or abstract ideas.
> [!INFO] Concept
To express this in concrete terms, we can say that the concept “cat” is the answer to the question “What is a cat?” If your answer is that a cat is an animal that is furry, meows, can be petted, moves, and catches mice, you will have described some aspects of the concept “cat” (Kiefer & Pulvermüller, 2012).

Category includes the examples of a concept.
> [!INFO] Category
> Thus, the category “cats” includes tabbies, Siamese cats, Persian cats, wildcats, leopards, and so on. Looked at in this way, concepts provide the rules for creating categories.

Fast sytem vs. slow system
- fast system immediately classifies the object 

Function of categories
- allow us to identitfy sth that we have never seen
- provides general information

General >> Specific
Novice   >> Expert
## Approach to categories
Definitional approach
- concepts are fussy and doesn't have a clear definition about what belongs or not belongs to the concept

Exemplar approach
- compare the new member of the already existing members 
- preferred when there are two cluster in the category which differs a lot
- only works for smaller categories

Prototype approach
- first find a not existing, ideal prototype in the members of the category
- compare the new member to the prototype 
## Levels of categories
Three levels
- Global: Furniture
- Basic: Table
- Specific: Kitchen table

The basic level of categorization depends on the degree of expertise of the person.
# Semantic network approach
[[Collins and Quillian’s Hierarchical Model]]
- cognitive economy
	- sth that is shared by more than one memeber will be stored ar a higher level node, such as we will think that a bird can sing but not a specific bird species. 
	- exceptions are then belonged to that lower node
