# What is perception
Perception has several characteristics.
Perception
- is a conscious experience from stimulation of senses
- can be changed by added information
- involves in complex, invisible processing that resembles reasoning ^99e382
	- an example of this would be the [[Multiple Personalities of a Blob]]
- occurs in conjunction with an action
# Difficulty in designing a perceiving machine
1. The stimulus is ambiguous
	- The Inverse Projection Problem![[Web capture_12-3-2023_155235_.jpeg]]
		- the image on the retina did not specify which pairing caused the image therefore we cannot inverse the image
2. Objects can be hidden or blurred
	- Humans can identify objects that are obsure and incomplete
	- Humans can use general knowledge to 'guess' incomplete objects while computers hardly can
3. Objects look different in different viewpoints
	- Viewpoint Invariance: the ability to recognize an object seen from different viewpoints
	- Humans can easily recognize an object as the same in different angles but the computer requires very complex calculations
4. Scenes contain high-level information
	- objects in the scene might contain information about the scene that needs reasoning as said before in [[Lecture 1 - Perception#^99e382|here]]
	- Humans can identify a airplane show by the people walking around casually instead of waiting onboard, while computers need to be programmed
# How does the human brain process?
The brain processes through bottom-up processing and top-down processing.
- Bottom-up comes from the receptors, what we truely sense 
- Top-down comes from our knowledge and expectations, in other words, general knowledge
	- this is the part that computers usually lack
## Perceiving objects
- [[Multiple Personalities of a Blob]]
## Hearing words in a sentence
- the listener has to know the language (top-down) to perform speech segmentation, which identifies the sentence into separate words instead of a long, continous line.
- transitional probabilities 
	- is learnt without realizing when learning a new language
		- this process is called statistical learning
	- shows the likelihood that one sound follows within a specific word.
		- eg. '*hello there*' although sounds continous but '*lo*' and '*the*' can be easily separated into the last sound of 'hello' and the first sound of 'there' instead of 'hel *lothe*re'.
# Concepts of object perception
## Unconsious inference
[[Helmholtz's Theory of Unconscious Inference]] suggests that some of the perceptions are the results of our unconscious predictions/assumptions we make to our environment.
- Likelihood Principle
	- we perceive the object that matches with the pattern of stimuli we have received
An example would be![[msedge_zHbGHtjsyA.png]]
## Gestalt approach
The [[Gestalt Principle]] is a counter argument of [[Structuralism]], its idea is that we would not perceive meaningless objects but meaningful ones.
It includes several laws below.
### Principles  of good continuation
![[msedge_JYzfcwasCZ 1.png]]
- lines follow the smoothest path
- points when connected, are seen as belonging together
- objects that are overlapped are seen as continuing under the object above instead of breaking
### Law of Pragnanz
![[Web capture_12-3-2023_161728_.jpeg]]
- we will perceive images as simple as possible, five rings instead of complex structurres 
- The ring could be actually split into atoms if wanted, according to [[Structuralism]], however, it would not be meaningful to humans.
### Principle of similarity
![[Web capture_12-3-2023_16195_.jpeg|250]]![[msedge_oCEdEWKHbF.png|300]]
Similar things group together. When seeing (b), we tend to see the dots vertically.
## Regular environments affects human perception
### Physical regularities
- these are regular physical properties occuring in the environment
	- **oblique effect**: people observe horizontal and vertical objects easier than slant objects
	- **light-from-above assumption**: people consider the light and shadows of a scene, perceiving objects in different ways because of this![[Web capture_12-3-2023_16263_.jpeg]]
### Semantic regularities
- scene shema
