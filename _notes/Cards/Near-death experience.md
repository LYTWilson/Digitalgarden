# The research in NDE
## The first research
The first one to investigate NDE through scientific method is [[Dr. Raymond Moody]], the book be [[Life after Life]], the phrase 'NDE' came from his book. 
NDE was divided into nine phases and 15 elements, which wasn't used now.
## The five phases and WCEI
[[Dr. Kenneth Ring]] first classified NDE into five phases, which is still the most confidential explanation of NDE
The five phase being
- 60% feel peace, rarely felt negatively
- 37% had out of body experience
- 25% went through a dark tunnel
- 16% saw light, some were religious figures and some had flashbacks
- 10% entered a spiritual place which was beautiful and gods or ancestors might appear, requesting them to leave the place.
[[Weighted Core Experience Index]] was designed, however, was not supported as it was not relaible in statistics and not well-designed.
## [[NDE Scale]]
The [[NDE Scale]] was developed shortly after the [[Weighted Core Experience Index|WCEI]] by [[Dr. Bruce Greyson]], which was found to have good reliabilty, consistency and re-test reliability. The scale is still the most recognized scale in nowaday phemenology and psychology in testing NDE.

## 人格分離論
- it might be a defense mechanism for preventing a mental breakdown, creating mirages to preserve more energy for future rescue, increasing the chance to live
Argue from NDEs would be that the person knows that he is himself but not another person.
## 出生回溯論
## 自我滿足論
## 分散注意論
