	- Price elasticity of demand
		- Avalibality of subsititute affects the elasticity
		- inelastic demand >> customers are not sensitive to change in price >> have great flexibility to raise price
			- AID drugs
		- elastic demand >> customers are very sensitve to the change in price >> dont't have much flexibility to raise price
			- coke %%Assumption is that customers are not loyal to the brand of coke%%
	- How to estimate demand?
		- helmet with a hole
			- how many drivers with long hair in HK? >> 10000
			- how many units will each buyer buy? >> 1
			- predict the share >> 4%
			- Qs >> 400
		- facilitate production scheduling
3. Determine costs
	- Variable cost (VC): you need to pay this for every unit you produce
	- Fixed cost (FC): sth that can use forever or a long time regardless the number of the units you produce
 4. Evaluate the pricing environment
	 - Consumer trends
	 - The economy
		 - one dollar chicker
		 - pay cut whopper

cost-based pricing
- fail to consider lots of features
- Relatively risk free 
- hard to estimate 
	- labor
	- investment
	- R&D

Price based on demand
- design product and make sure that its unit cost doesn’t exceed the selling price
- yield management pricing
	- possible factors to charge different prices
		- online history
		- price sensitive
		- computer model
- dynamic pricing
	- adjusted to meet changes in marketplace
	- ski lift ticket adjust prices based on weather
	- eg. trial and error tickets

Price based on competition
- eg. Park-n-Shop: “Price Watch Product”
- Oligopoly

Price based on customer’s needs
- Walmart set low price to their products
- uses value pricing or everyday low pricing (EDLP)

What is value?

value = Perceived benefit/Perceived cost

New product pricing
- skimming price %%difference between skimming and dynamic? Maybe skimming can enjoy products first.%%
	- charge a high price first then lower prices in reponse to market 
	- there must be substancial amount of customers that are not price-sensitive 
- trial pricing
	- low price for a limited time period to win customer’s acceptance
	- will increase the price later
	- eg. Apple Daily: $2 when entering the market
- penetration pricing
	- low price can be maintained a long time period
	- works when market is price sensitive
	- eg. QB House
	- eg. budget airline

Pricing for individual products
- two-part pricing
	- eg. taxi: fixed fee and variable usage rate
- payment pricing
	- breaking up the total price into smaller amounts over time
	- eg. Uni tuition fee break into every semester

Pricing for mutiple products
- price bundling 
	- coke pakage
- captive pricing
	- eg. printer and printer ink

Distribution pricing
- freight distribution
	- no need to pay shipping

Psychological pricing
- reference pricing
	- based on internal reference price
	- show both the discount price and original price
	- makes the customer think the new price is fair
	- assimilation effect
		- two products have similar prices => similar quality
	- contrast effect
		- two products have large price difference => large quality differencej
- odd-even pricing
	- $199 perceived as $100
