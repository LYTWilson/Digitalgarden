- Self esteems are our feelings about ourselves. 
- Those that have a high esteem have a better self image and values themselves more in abilities and achievements.
# The three images
The self esteem is a combination of these images
- Self-image
- Ideal self
- Pygmalion-self
The pygmalion-self could be misguided as people may have a subjective or biased perception on how other think themselves, such as some may think themselves as uninteresting, boring or lazy.
