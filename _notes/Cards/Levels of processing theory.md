The memory depends how the encoding of information, and the LOP theory states that there is a deeper processing and shallower processing.

Deep processing involves in the attention to concepts,meanings, and relationships of an item to another item.

Shallow processing involves repetition with little attention to the above.

An elaborative rehearsal is better than a maintenance rehearsal because it involves the meaning of an item and the connections of that item.

Examples:
- Shallow Processing: A question about physical features of the word 
	- Question: Is the word printed in capital letters? 
	- Word: “bird” 
- Deeper Processing: A question about rhyming 
	- Question: Does the word rhyme with “train”? 
	- Word: “pain” 
- Deepest Processing: A fill-in-the-blanks question 
	- Question: Does the word fit into the sentence “He saw a ________ on the street”?
	- Word: "Car"



critism: 
- LOPpaper-lack of objective measurement of depth of processing.....
- only encoding, retrieval?? ES shows that the context matters, eg. witnesses in the same environment, habitual cues, should not do anything except sleeping on bed etc... #to-revise
- encoding specificity?? Encoding specificity shows that some context could be learned
