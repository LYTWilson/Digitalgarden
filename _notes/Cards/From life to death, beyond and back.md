# First phase: realization
- all pain, anxiety, noices are gone, only peace and joy
- the insight that they are death
# Second phase: out of the body
- can feel the medics are saving himself and know what had happened nearby in an out of the body perspective
# Third phase: dark space
- into a dark, confined space
- most said it was comfortable, soothing, only 1-2% said that it was terrifying, has monsters or horrible noises
# Fouth phase: light
- attractive light at the end of a dark tunnel 
# Fifth phase: end
- 10% might have a flash back of their whole life
- feel unconditional love and a very beautiful place
- half said that their relatives or a being of light welcomed them and told them to go back that they have something not yet fulfilled
- half said that they felt that they had decided to come back due to something they had not yet fulfilled
# Changes after coming back
- less materialistic
- care more about relationships
