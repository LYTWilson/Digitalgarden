	- Lego invite ppl. to share ideas online and choose some of the best ideas to be a product idea
	- Open-plan working space to encourage more brainstorming 
		- %%Maybe the culture in the office affects the effectiveness of this plan. A extra leisure workspace like a cafe might be better in this case?%%
